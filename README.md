# Wandering Lines

An exploration of lines wandering across a space. Inspired from the work of [Anders Hoff, @inconvergent](https://github.com/inconvergent).

# Running locally

Make sure [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed, download this repo, then from the folder in the command line run `npm install` to install the dependencies, then run `npm run dev:1` to start a local reload server. Then to finish and build the final files run `npm run build:1`. Replace the `1` in `dev:1` and `build:1` to run and build each version in the series.
